An ESP32 with three buttons and a connection to an exercise machine's
rotation sensor (or perhaps a Hall effect sensor) can emulate the controller
for CSA's Computer Athlete software: https://archive.org/details/computerathlete 

The default setup uses a game controller, and the default mappings should work
with dosbox just fine.

This requires these libraries:
 NimBLE-Arduino (I am using 2.1.2)
 ESP32-BLE-Gamepad
